        /* Primitive types store the actual value directly in memory, which results in high memory
        efficiency and faster access speed. On the other hand, reference types store memory addresses
        that point to complex objects or data structures stored elsewhere in memory.The primitive types are
         boolean , byte , char , short , int , long , float and double .


Reference types hold references to objects and provide a means to access those objects stored somewhere in memory.
The memory locations are irrelevant to programmers. All reference types are a subclass of type java.
